Idea:

- Microswitch buttons embedded in the cover of an A5 notebook. 
- Notebook held with the covers+pages placed perpendicularly to the medial phalangeus of digits 2-5.
- Side A: 4 microswitches for the tips of distal phalanges
- Side B: Two microswitches - one for for PIP joint and tip of phalangeus of the thumb.
- So far connected to Arduino and HID usb. Bluetooth is a next step.
